## Definition
[[202104152101 Certificate Pinning|Certificate pinning]] is, in what I understand, a additional protection layer developers add to their apps or website to avoid a user to use other certificates to `access` the `service`. On the first connection, your `certificate` is stored by the `server` and only traffic with trusted `certificates` is accepted.  ^57b6bd
