#  202110102251 BIMServer
#BIM #Sweco 
## Installation
BIMServer is build on Java. A Java runtime is necessary to run the build. We rely on the open source implementation of the Java, Standard Edition - [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).

First, check you java installation, and in case you have one, it might be required to just install the version 11. In that case, first delete the old version:
```shell
apt-get purge -y openjdk-\* 
```

Next, install the version 11:

```shell
apt install -y openjdk-11-jre-headless tomcat9 tomcat9-user
```

Apache Tomcat 9 (10 is not backwards compatible and BIMServer still relies on an older implementation) is used to run the web server, which is stored as a `.war` file. 

After installation, check you `/etc/passwd` if a new Tomcat user is created. 

We create a new folder wherever we like. We'll stick to `/var/www/` because we're hosting a website. 

```shell
mkdir /var/www/ && chmod -R tomcat /var/www
tomcat9-instance-create -p <port> -c <console> /var/www/<domain>
```

After creation of a new project for a specific domain, we'll add the app to the webapps folder inside the newly created project. It's self contained and all necessary settings should be tweaked inside the `/var/www/<domain>` folder. 
```shell
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/opensourceBIM/BIMServer/releases/latest | grep "browser_download_url.*war" | cut -d : -f 2,3 | tr -d \" | wget -qi - -O /var/www/<domain>/webapps/bimserver.war
```
Next, we define a **daemon** so the service is started at runtime.
```shell
vim /etc/systemd/system/tomcat@.service
```
In this file, enter the following content:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Tomcat - instance %i
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=forking

User=tomcat
Group=tomcat

WorkingDirectory=/var/www/%i

Environment="JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-arm64/"
Environment="JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom"
Environment="CATALINA_OPTS=-Xms512M -Xmx512M -server -XX:+UseParallelGC"

ExecStart=/var/www/%i/bin/startup.sh
ExecStop=/var/www/%i/bin/shutdown.sh

#RestartSec=10
#Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Watch out!
```ad-danger
In my case I'm running the script on a Raspberry Pi, you might need to change the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-openjdk-amd64` instead of `arm64`. 
```
After configuring the service, load, enable and start it. 
```shell
# Reload all deamons
systemctl daemon-reload
# Enable and start the daemon
systemctl enable tomcat@<domain>
systemctl start tomcat@<domain>
```
Check the status at:
```shell
systemctl status tomcat@<domain>
```
Navigate to the BIMServer using `<domain>:<port>`in your webbrowser.
