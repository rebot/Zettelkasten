#  202110102251 BIMServer
#BIM #Sweco 
## Installation
BIMServer is build on Java. A Java runtime is necessary to run the build. We rely on the open source implementation of the Java, Standard Edition - [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).

```shell
apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless tomcat9 tomcat9-user
```

Apache Tomcat 9 (10 is not backwards compatible and BIMServer still relies on an older implementation) is used to run the web server, which is stored as a `.war` file. 

After installation, check you `/etc/passwd` if a new Tomcat user is created. 

We create a new folder wherever we like. We'll stick to `/var/www/` because we're hosting a website. 

```shell
mkdir /var/www/ && chmod -R tomcat /var/www
tomcat9-instance-create -p <port> -c <console> /var/www/<domain>
```

After creation of a new project for a specific domain, we'll add the app to the webapps folder inside the newly created project. It's self contained and all necessary settings should be tweaked inside t
