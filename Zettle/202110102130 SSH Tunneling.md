#SSH #commandline 
## Local port forwarding
Mount port 80 of the external host (remote server `home.local`) to the port `8080`of the local host. The `-N` flag prevents the initiation of an interactive session. 
```shell
ssh -N -L 8080:localhost:80 eetietshekken@home.local
```

## Remote port forwarding
Also called *SSH Reverse tunneling*. Redirects the remote server's port to the local host's port. The client initiates the connection, then a tunnel is created (a socket listener is initiated by the server at the defined port) to forward incoming traffic to the server back to the client. It can be achieved with the `-R` flag. For example:
```shell
ssh -N -R 8080:localhost:1234 eetietshekken@home.local
```
In order to make this work, it's also necessary to adjust the `GatewayPorts`default setting
```shell
sudo sed -i 's/#?GatewayPorts.*/GatewayPorts yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
