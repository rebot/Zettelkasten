# Vandaag 19 March 2021
## Birth of [Gilles.is](http://gillesis.netlify.app)
#netlify #gatsby #react #mdx #md #zettelkasten
The idea is to bridge the gap between my *Zettelkasten* archive and the blog *I'm once gonna make*. So here we are, attempt number 21.... So I'm storing my notes/ideas/journals as `.md`or *Markdown* files. Those files are stored in a *git* repository which I share with the public on [Github]. 

I'm aiming to create a statically website, no interaction/login is required. I have no intention to allow comments on my blog and  in case people noticed a typo or have some suggestion, they can open an issue on [Github]. I've enabled *Discussions* on [Github] so people are free to discuss one of my blogpost. Maybe I add the interaction with [Github] and [Gilles.is] in the future. 

> Sidenote: [Gilles.is] is not yet registered! oops..

### Git Submodule
My first is idea was to use Git *Submodule* to 

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

```
