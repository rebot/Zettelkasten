## MDX Images
#markdown #gatsby #blog    
The one missing features is `images`.

## Tags
Another remaining feature is to extract `tags` from the markdown file. Tags are defined by using a `hash` symbol followed by an alphanumeric value.   

Markdown is converted into [[Abstract Syntax Tree|AST]] or [[Abstract Syntax Tree]] during build time. It's generated on the pages that are exposed by the `source`plugins for [[Gatsby]]. To get started, I advice you to read the article about making a [Remark plugin]. 

I advice you to play around in the online [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/#/gist/521a1d362b01aa8376027cc67d8e0c4d/latest) to get a feeling of the syntax tree. 

## Gatsby

I'm writing about _gatsby_ to test a new plugin `remark-jargon`.
