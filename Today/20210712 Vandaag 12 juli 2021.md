# Vandaag 2021-07-12
#note/daily #mood/indifferent
<< [[20210711]] | [[20210713]] >>
## Obsidian.md
#obsidian/plugin #zettelkasten 
Today I'm learning about two new plugins I'll be using in the future, [Templater]  and [Dataview]. Both are very powerfull. 

First of all, I'm no longer relying on the build in **template system** of Obsidian.md. [Templater] comes with *date* support, but also allow to run arbitrary *javascript* code within the templates. In fact, this note is created using [Templater]. 

Secondly, [Dataview] is a plugin which allow to query for related notes based on a bunch of parameters related to each note. In our particular case, the [[20210712 Vandaag 12 juli 2021#What's going on]] section in this note is created using [Dataview]. 

```
list
from "Zettle"
where file.ctime >= date(2021-07-09) and file.ctime <= date(2021-07-15) 
```
**Zettles** are queried that are created in a timespan of 3 days before the creation of the **daily note** and 3 days afterwards. 

## What's going on?
The following list contains an overview of all **zettels** that have been created within a timespan of  **3 days before and after** the creation of this **daily note**. 

```dataview
list
from "Zettle"
where file.ctime >= date(2021-07-09) and file.ctime <= date(2021-07-15) 
```
