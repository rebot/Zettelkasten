## Exploring my *digital garden* ğŸŒ³

To my understanding, a [[2023-08-16 Digital Garden|Digital garden]] is simply a free mess of thoughts, **loosly coupled** with *tags*, *references* (a.k.a *hyperlinks*). As a note taking app, I fell in love with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) ğŸ§¡. To get rolling, I used the following **plugins**. 

| Plugin          | Usage                                                                         | Reference                                                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Advanced Tables | A *no-brainer*, provides automatic **table formatting** and even formulas! ğŸª„ | [Github](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian) |
| Dataview        | **Query engine** for your Obsidian vault, like threating it as a *database*   | [Github](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)      |
| Templater       | Define **note templates** to be used automatically used on *note creation* ğŸ“š                                                                              | [Github](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)                                                                 |

The **3 plugins** above for the **backbone** of my *note taking method*. However, other plugins are selected to further support my note taking expirience, e.i. [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin), [MAKE.md](https://www.make.md/) and [Style settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings).

### Launcher

I stick to [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for almost a decade now. It's my go-to *Launcher* for *MacOS*. I'm still using it just because I'm used to it. Certainly **not** because of it's feature (which I'm not using at its full potential), and not of it's *UI*, considering it's recent rival, [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) which looks much nicer. **Both** have an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) integration.   

### Daily notes

I read a [blogpost](https://quail.ink/goldengrape/p/write-diary-with-chatgpt-en) that shares some expierence on a clever *prompt engineering* techique to make a nice *essay* from a set of **unstructured small notes** you take during the using, by means of a [[2023-08-16 Large Language Model (LLM)|Large Language Model (LLM)]]. 

### Publishing

Their are plenty of tools to **publish** your *notes*. Some of them are:
- [Quail](https://docs.quail.ink/)
- [Obsidiosaurus](https://github.com/CIMSTA/obsidiosaurus) ğŸ¦–
